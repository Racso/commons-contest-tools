# Contest Tools for Wikimedia Commons

This repository contains some tools I've created to help running photographic contests in Wikimedia Commons.

The tools were originally created in 2012 for "Wiki Loves Monuments: Colombia", and have received few updates since then. Recently (April 2018), I've been cleaning them a bit.

## Tools
### judge.php
![code cleanup 90%](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20cleanup-90%25-green.svg)

This tool can be used by the judges of a contest to filter the best photos in order to pick the contest winners.

Its original version is deployed in http://wikimediacolombia.org/vacaciones/juez.

### stats.php
![code cleanup 40%](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20cleanup-40%25-yellow.svg)

This tool shows some interesting stats about the contest.

Its original version is deployed in http://wikimediacolombia.org/vacaciones/stats.
