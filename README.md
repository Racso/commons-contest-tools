# Contest Tools for Wikimedia Commons

This repository contains some tools I've created to help running photographic contests in Wikimedia Commons. They are aimed to be as simple to install as possible, so I try to make each tool in a single file.

The tools were originally created in 2012 for "Wiki Loves Monuments: Colombia", and have received few updates since then. Recently (April 2018), I've been cleaning them a bit.

## Tools
### judge.php

This tool can be used by the judges of a contest to filter the best photos in order to pick the contest winners.
